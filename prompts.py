FILTER_SEARCH_RESULTS_PROMPT = """
You are a product search relevance expert. Given a user's query and a list of product search results, your task is to **remove any results that are clearly irrelevant** to the query.

Do not reorder the results and maintain their original order. Simply filter out the entries that do not align with the user's intent.

Use the following criteria to assess relevance:
- Match with the user's keywords and intent
- Accuracy and completeness of the product information
- Trustworthiness of the source
    - Do not use the reviews count to determine trustworthiness, rely on your general knowledge of the domain or brand instead.
- Price or offering must be reasonably related to the query
- Overall usefulness of the result for satisfying the user's query

User query:
{user_query}

Search results:
{formatted_results}

Some examples on when to exclude results:
- The product is for a **different brand or model** not mentioned in the query.
  - Example: User searches for "iPhone 14" and the result is "Samsung Galaxy S22".
- The product is a **completely unrelated accessory**.
  - Example: Query is "MacBook Pro" but the result is a "laptop bag" or "keyboard protector".
- The listing contains **generic, misleading, or incomplete information**.
  - Example: A result that says “Best Laptop” without any specs or brand.
- The source is **untrustworthy or suspicious**.
  - Example: A link from a site known for scams or clickbait offers.
- The price or offering is **wildly inconsistent** with the typical product value.
  - Example: Query is "budget smartphones" and result is a $3000 flagship device.
